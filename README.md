A collection of GLSL shaders used for my Extended Essay on fractals.

### Notes on the files
Most of these files are derivatives of my original Shadertoy code that can be found [here](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WtdfDM). Huge thanks to inigo quilez, or [@iquilezles](https://twitter.com/iquilezles) for the incredible knowledge avaliable through his site about shaders, SDFs and fractals. Many of these shaders also feature code inspired by [his extremely useful SDF cheat sheet featuring GLSL formulae for boxes and stuff](https://iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions/distfunctions.htm).

Many of these files are also experiments/recolored versions of existing shaders with values tweaked. I debated whether to include these in the repo since they are the same code with some slightly different constants, but in the interest of showing where the pictures in the essay came from they're all here. The only exception to this rule is the cited images from the essay (such as the first published Mandelbrot Set [from 1976](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Mandel.png) which I labelled as such in the essay because interestingly it was *not* generated by Benoit Mandelbrot himself), and the "mandelmountain" images, which I instead chose to render in blender (.blend files available) from a heightmap generated by a shader in the repo, because it looked pretty and was less effort at the time.

If you're reading this confused about which essay I'm talking about, I'll upload it here after I graduate the IB. Until then I can't because it has the potential to identify me. If you're the IB marker reading this, I made sure not to put my name on this GitHub account either, so I should be safe uploading it here.
